# ABSTRACT:

  The Wiper speed control framework regulates the wiper's functional speed based on the downpour condition. 
  It removes raindrops or other fluids from the vehicle's windscreen. The previous framework required mannual
  wiper actuation, and the activity of raising the wiper was difficult to accommodate. As a result, this 
  strategy is proposed to resolve the problem. The task will most likely continue to mature the auto frameworks 
  by providing robotized transmission. The majority of vehicles have two wipers, one on the back window and one 
  on the front.The elastic sharp edge, the wiper arm holding the cutting edge, a spring linkage, and portions of 
  the wiper turns are visible from the vehicles. The caution gear can generate the power required to move the 
  wipers as needed. We now have the computerised control wiper framework; if we stop in the middle of the cycle, 
  it will return to the starting position; this is the new wiper framework behind the wiper arm. The guidelines 
  of this proposed wiper framework are nearly identical to those of other existing customary wipers.
  
  # FEATURES:
    . When the button is pressed once, the vehicle is locked.
    . When the button is pressed twice, the vehicle will be opened.
    . When the button is squeezed three times, the wiper turns on and moves clockwise.
    . It will wiper off and move counterclockwise when the button is squeezed multiple times. 
    . When the button is squeezed several times, the wiper will complete one cycle.
